                        <p>Hi, my name is Oanh Tran. I’m a high school student at Clovis East and CART, Center for Advanced Research and Technology. I live in Clovis, California. I have a background in HTML, CSS, Javascript and C++. For me programming is solving a puzzle and communicating the result in a foreign language. I being able to constantly learn new things and apply it to my project.
                            <br><br>I’m taking honor and AP courses at school. I currently have a 3.9 GPA. I also take part in Robotic and Mock Trial. I programmed the 2017 robot for Robotic and I play the role of an attorney for Mock Trial. I had built a few small websites in Web Application class. One of the website was about Hawkbill Sea Turtle, and the other was about information security.
                            <br><br> On my free time, I read and play guitar. I am a self taught guitarist and playing it gives me time to think.
                            <br><br>I hope that this introduction and my website gives an idea of who I am. I can be contacted through my email, oanhtran901@gmail.com, or through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oanh-tran-bb425015b/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
