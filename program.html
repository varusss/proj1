                The first sample that I chose to showcase my technology skills is a website about the Hawksbill Sea Turtle. This website is built using only HTML and CSS. I used the software called Bracket to write the code of the website. Before I start coding, I designed a mock up page for it. Then I gather information about the sea turtle. Finally, I write the code. I learn to plan out what is my design for the website and where my content will go. The skill I learn here can help me write a better website and in a shorter amount of time since I know what the process is.

                This is my Zen Garden page. The objective to this project is to learn about CSS and design a premade HTML website. I use Bracket to do this project. Only CSS was allow to use in this project. It was a bit of a challenge since I’m not very familiar with CSS pseudo classes. I learn about a few websites that I can use to help understand more about CSS.

                This is part of a autonomous routine I wrote for my school robotic team. I write it in a computer language called C++. It was a bit challenging since it the first time I write C++ program. I didn’t know about the TimeStamp command that I can use to set time limit and delay. I use an IDE called Eclipse to write my program in. I learn to cooperate with people I don’t like. As I don’t know many thing about the robot so I have to constantly ask the people who built the robot what is needed to be include in the code.
